## Number of listed pages

Tweaks the number of pages visible in one list view screen **globally**. Default number is 25.

So it allows to define global limit for **all clonable templates** to save time.

Even if you set a new globally-applied number via this tweak you can still override it in usual manner &mdash;
```html
<cms:config_list_view limit='5' />
```
The code above will set a limit for a single template, where the tag appears.
