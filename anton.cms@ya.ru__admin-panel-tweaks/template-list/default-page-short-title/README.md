## Default page tweak

The very first cloned page normally has a very long title &mdash;

> `Default page for index.php *PLEASE CHANGE THIS TITLE*`

This tweak keeps the title short, simply

> `Default page for index.php`

Additionally, page is auto-unpublished.

It is a significant time saver for experienced developers.
